Synthetic Lethality – Data Analysis

## Overview
This project contains an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) in a Jupyter Notebook.  
The notebook focuses on feature analysis, dimensionality reduction, clustering, correlation analysis, and class imbalance handling.

The pipeline combines statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to extract structure and insights from the dataset.

## Objectives

- Perform structured **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyze feature distributions and correlations
- Handle **class imbalance**
- Apply **Dimensionality Reduction**
- Perform **Clustering**
- Evaluate clustering quality
- Visualize patterns in reduced feature space
