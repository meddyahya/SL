Mutation Data:
    Sample_ID:  A TCGA barcode representing the metadata of the participants and their samples.
    gene: Gene Name
    chrom: the type of chorome (1,2,X,Y,...)
    start: the start coordinate of the gene. It is counted by the index number of the base it starts with.
    end: the end coordinate of the gene. It is counted by the index number of the base it ends with.
    ref: are base letters. The reference base, or allele, which is what the human genome normally has. "-" This value can be missing values or just the tumour is inserting new bases without changing basis.
    alt: are base letters. The alternate base or allele, which found in the tumour, representing the mutation
    Amino_Acid_Change: An amino acid change refers to a variation in the sequence of amino acids within a protein, often caused by a mutation in the DNA. This change can impact the protein's structure and function, potentially leading to altered biological activity or disease. 
    effect: The functional consequence of the mutation on the coding sequence
    filter: whether the mutation passed all tests to verify it's actually a mutation not an artifact, recurrent sequencing noise,...
    dna_vaf: Variant allele frequency in tumor DNA

    Missing Values can be represented by "-"; check the unique values later on
